# Just-Shapes-And-Beats

A final year unit task which involved developing a prototype for a mechanic (in this case, the spawning of shapes – geometries – and assigning them a couple behaviours).
The main conceit was that it was meant to be a <b> prototype </b>, written quickly to provide a proof of concept, whilst simultaneously exploring the technical requirements
of creating such a system (i.e. efficiency, expandability).
